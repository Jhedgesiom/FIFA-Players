# Jack-Hedges

This is my first project and it's using a dataset of players from FIFA 19, (https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) where I am looking for the best players who improve the most from when they are bought. The idea being they are a very cheap buys but with training on the game they turn into top players in the game.

Any comments or ways I could have done it better are very welcome as trying to learn as much as possible.

Thanks
